3. What's the difference between a Push and Pull model? (FYI we'll be using Pull with our customers)

   Push – Uses Start-DscConfiguration to copy MOF to the target node.  The node then checks the configuration and again every 15 minutes (by default).  Manual process.  Non-core DSC resources must be manually deployed to nodes.
   Pull – Uses push mode to enroll the target node by configuring the pull server information.  Target nose then checks every 30 minutes to re-apply the configuration.  All resources and MOFs must be put on the pull server for the nodes to copy down.

4. In the pull model, where does a client node look for its configuration updates?  The configured pull server.

5. What format is the compiled configuration script in?  MOF

6. Why should you use SSL/HTTPS with the Pull Server model?  Security.  The configuration files could be easily spoofed.

7. Where would you configure the DSC refresh interval?  LCM

8. Which DSC resource module is used in the configuration script to create the pull server and its web services?   Start-DscConfiguration

9. In a DSC configuration file, what does the following script block do?  Ensure the node have the IIS feature installed.

	WindowsFeature IIS
			{
				Ensure 	= "Present"
				Name	= "Web-Server"
			}


10. What configuration script variable tells a client node the location of the pull server? *hint - minute 36 of the presentation.   ServerUrl

11. What is OMI?  Powershell DSC for Linux

12. What rocks the world?  Desired State Configuration on LINUX

13. What are the three pre-defined functions of a DSC resource module?  get, test, and set target resource.
